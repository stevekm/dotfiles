Dotfiles
========
This repository includes all of my custom dotfiles.  They should be cloned to
your home directory so that the path is `~/dotfiles/`.  The included setup
script creates symlinks from your home directory to the files which are located
in `~/dotfiles/`.

The setup script is smart enough to back up your existing dotfiles into a
`~/dotfiles_old/` directory if you already have any dotfiles of the same name as
the dotfile symlinks being created in your home directory.

So, to recap, the install script will:

1. Back up any existing dotfiles in your home directory to `~/dotfiles_old/`
2. Create symlinks to the dotfiles in `~/dotfiles/` in your home directory
3. Clone the `oh-my-zsh` repository from my GitHub (for use with `zsh`)
4. Check to see if `zsh` is installed, if it isn't, try to install it.
5. If zsh is installed, run a `chsh -s` to set it as the default shell.
