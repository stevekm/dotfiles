# remap prefix from 'C-b' to 'C-a'
unbind C-b
set-option -g prefix C-a
bind-key C-a send-prefix

#bind a send-prefix
# this only works for C-a...
#
# got this from ChatGPT

# Move to the start of the line
bind-key C-a send-prefix C-a

# Move to the end of the line
bind-key C-e send-prefix C-e

# it seems to be kinda working... C-e moves to end of line and
# C-a a moves to start
# if there are issues in tmux then re-examine this
