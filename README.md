# Dotfiles

This is a repository containing my custom dotfiles and device-independent commands that I include in them.
Right now, I am primarily interested in .bashrc file and .bash_profile. In future updates, others may be added.

# Installation

Clone this repo

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/stevekm/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
```

Run the Makefile to set up

```bash
make
```

Will probably have to exit the shell and restart for changes to take effect completely.

Should look like this:
